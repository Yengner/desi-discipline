# Desi-discipline
Study smarter with Desi Discipline ‚Äì track distractions, view session analytics, and get hilarious reminders from your desi mom when you wander off.

# Description
Desi Discipline is a focus tool inspired by the tough love of Indian moms who never let distractions slide. Some of us grew up with that no-nonsense discipline, and it kept us on track‚Äîso we decided to bring that same energy into the digital world. During your study sessions, Desi Discipline keeps you accountable by tracking your distractions. If you wander onto sites like Instagram or YouTube (without a good reason), you‚Äôll be met with an angry Indian mom GIF telling you to get back to work. The companion website shows you insights into your session, including how long you stayed focused and how many times you got distracted.
